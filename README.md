# Recipe Roundup

    Recipe Roundup is a foodie search engine designed to making your meal selection, and preparation, easier!

## Instructions
---
    You can either search for a type of food to look at a selection of recipes, or search for a specific meal to find the recipe.
    The result of your search will include a picture of the meal you are searching for. 

    For example, you can search for the type of food "beef" to look at the list of recipes, which includes but is not limited to; Beef Lo Mein, Beef Wellington, Beef Dumpling Stew, and Corned Beef and Cabbage.

    If you have something more specific in mind, such as, Katsu Chicken Curry, you can search for that dish and find a recipe that includes a picture of the finished meal. 

## Take a look and give it a try yourself!
