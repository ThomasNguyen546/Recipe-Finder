# Recipe Roundup

Recipe Roundup is a foodie search engine designed to making your meal selection, and preparation, easier!

## Instructions

You can either search for a type of food to look at a selection of recipes, or search for a specific meal to find the recipe.The result of your search will include a picture of the meal you are searching for. 

For example, you can search for the type of food "beef" to look at the list of recipes, which includes but is not limited to; Beef Lo Mein, Beef Wellington, Beef Dumpling Stew, and Corned Beef and Cabbage.

If you have something more specific in mind, such as, Katsu Chicken Curry, you can search for that dish and find a recipe that includes a picture of the finished meal. 

Along with searching for your favorite recipes, users will be able to enter in their zipcode and find grocery stores nearby to purchase necessary ingredients.
